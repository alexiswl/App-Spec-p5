=head1 NAME

App::Spec::Tutorial - How to write an app with App::Spec::Run

=head1 GENERATOR

You can generate a boilerplate with appspec:

    appspec new --class App::Birthdays --name birthdays.pl

For documentation, look at L<appspec> and L<App::AppSpec>.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head1 A minimal app called birthdays.pl

The smallest example would be the following app. It doesn't
use subcommands. Please note that completion for apps without subcommands
is still buggy.

=item birthdays.pl

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use 5.010;
    package App::Birthdays;
    use base 'App::Spec::Run::Cmd';

    sub execute {
        my ($self, $run) = @_;
        if (my $date = $run->options->{date}) {
            say "Birthdays $date:\n";
            print "Larry Wall";
            if ($run->options->{age}) {
                print " (Age: unknown)";
            }
            print "\n";
        }
    }

    package main;
    use App::Spec;

    App::Spec->read("$Bin/birthdays.yaml")->runner->run;

=item birthdays.yaml

    name: birthdays.pl
    title: Show birthdays
    appspec: { version: '0.001' }
    class: App::Birthdays
    options:
    - name: date
      type: string
      default: today
    - name: age
      type: flag
